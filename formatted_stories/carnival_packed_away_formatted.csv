0,carnival_packed_away,The sun hung low and bright over the coastal town as the summer festival kicked off its first evening.
1,carnival_packed_away,"For Lucy, summer didn’t truly begin until the carnival lights flickered on, until the smell of kettle corn and sea salt blended together in the warm air."
2,carnival_packed_away,She had waited months for this.
3,carnival_packed_away,It was her favorite week of the year.
4,carnival_packed_away,"She rushed through the entrance with a burst of giddy energy, nearly tripping over her own sandals. “Come on, Theo!” she called to her younger brother, who jogged behind her, laughing."
5,carnival_packed_away,Music pulsed from the Ferris wheel speakers.
6,carnival_packed_away,Children ran with cotton candy taller than their heads.
7,carnival_packed_away,Performers on stilts waved as they passed.
8,carnival_packed_away,Everything shimmered with color and possibility. “First ride?” Theo asked. “Pirate Ship!” Lucy said without hesitation.
9,carnival_packed_away,"The ship swung high over the festival tents, the ocean coming into view at the peak of each arc."
10,carnival_packed_away,"Lucy screamed with delight, her stomach flipping in that uniquely carnival way."
11,carnival_packed_away,"Theo shouted something unintelligible, equal parts exhilaration and terror."
12,carnival_packed_away,"They spent hours bouncing from ride to ride: bumper cars, the spinning teacups, the ridiculous funhouse mirrors."
13,carnival_packed_away,"When they finally sat down to eat, they piled the table with fried dough, cheesy fries, and frozen lemonade."
14,carnival_packed_away,"Lucy grinned so hard her cheeks hurt. “Can this last forever?” she asked. “No way,” Theo said, stuffing a fry into his mouth. “But it can last all night.” Lucy liked the idea."
15,carnival_packed_away,"She wanted the sparkling lights and wild motion and laughter to stretch into something permanent, a bubble of joy untouched by reality."
16,carnival_packed_away,"But even bubbles, she knew, eventually popped."
17,carnival_packed_away,The first crack came when the fireworks started.
18,carnival_packed_away,"They burst in spectacular blooms across the sky—reds, greens, dazzling golds."
19,carnival_packed_away,The crowd gasped and applauded.
20,carnival_packed_away,Lucy felt her chest swell with happiness so bright she could hardly contain it.
21,carnival_packed_away,Then her phone buzzed.
22,carnival_packed_away,At first she ignored it.
23,carnival_packed_away,"But when it buzzed again, then again, something uneasy stirred in her stomach."
24,carnival_packed_away,She pulled it out: three missed calls from Mom.
25,carnival_packed_away,"Her father’s name appeared on the fourth call, though he rarely phoned her directly."
26,carnival_packed_away,Lucy answered. “Dad?
27,carnival_packed_away,I’m at the carnival—” His voice was the sound that changed the summer. “Lucy… your grandmother collapsed.
28,carnival_packed_away,She’s at the hospital.
29,carnival_packed_away,"It’s not good.” The carnival noises muted around her, as though pushed behind a thick wall of glass."
30,carnival_packed_away,"Fireworks still exploded overhead, but they felt wrong now—too loud, too bright, too alive. “We’re coming to get you and Theo,” her father said. “Stay where you are.” Lucy hung up, her hands trembling."
31,carnival_packed_away,"Theo looked at her, still grinning from the fireworks. “What’s wrong?” Lucy didn’t know how to say it."
32,carnival_packed_away,So she just took his hand and held it tightly until their parents arrived.
33,carnival_packed_away,The ride to the hospital was quiet except for the hum of tires on asphalt.
34,carnival_packed_away,Theo asked questions their parents didn’t answer.
35,carnival_packed_away,Lucy stared out the window at the fading fireworks in the distance.
36,carnival_packed_away,"Just an hour earlier, she’d wished the night would last forever."
37,carnival_packed_away,"Be careful what you wish for, she thought bitterly."
38,carnival_packed_away,Beautiful things only last because they end.
39,carnival_packed_away,"At the hospital, the sterile smell and harsh lighting crushed the last remnants of carnival magic."
40,carnival_packed_away,"Lucy’s grandmother—Nana Jo—had always been the warmest part of their family, the one who baked cookies on random Tuesdays and told stories with hands that danced like birds."
41,carnival_packed_away,"Now she lay still and pale, machines doing the breathing she once did with laughter."
42,carnival_packed_away,Lucy stayed by her bedside long after Theo fell asleep in a waiting-room chair.
43,carnival_packed_away,"She whispered memories, hoping Nana Jo could hear them: the summer picnics at the lake, the way she hummed old songs while folding laundry, the time she taught Lucy to sew a crooked little pillow shaped like a star."
44,carnival_packed_away,"But the machines kept beeping in steady, indifferent rhythm."
45,carnival_packed_away,"Around dawn, a nurse gently squeezed her shoulder. “She’s fading,” she said softly."
46,carnival_packed_away,Lucy’s parents woke Theo.
47,carnival_packed_away,"The four of them stood around the bed as the monitors slowed, then stuttered, then softened into a flat silence."
48,carnival_packed_away,The absence of sound was unbearable.
49,carnival_packed_away,"When they returned home later, the carnival was gone."
50,carnival_packed_away,Not literally—they could still see its Ferris wheel rising over the boardwalk from their window.
51,carnival_packed_away,"But for Lucy, its joy was now unreachable, locked behind grief’s heavy curtain."
52,carnival_packed_away,"Even the distant laughter drifting from the rides felt intrusive, almost cruel."
53,carnival_packed_away,"The following day, her friends begged her to come back to the festival, to “get her mind off things.” But Lucy couldn’t imagine stepping into that world again."
54,carnival_packed_away,"The colors would be too bright, the music too upbeat, the smells too sweet."
55,carnival_packed_away,"The carnival would go on, of course."
56,carnival_packed_away,Joy was stubborn that way.
57,carnival_packed_away,But hers was dimmed now.
58,carnival_packed_away,"Each night she listened to the echoes of fireworks, remembering how they once made her feel."
59,carnival_packed_away,"Remembering how quickly feelings could collapse, like tents being packed away."
60,carnival_packed_away,"On the last night of the carnival, she finally forced herself to walk to the boardwalk."
61,carnival_packed_away,Not to ride anything—just to say goodbye to the season she’d started so happily.
62,carnival_packed_away,The Ferris wheel spun slowly against the night sky.
63,carnival_packed_away,Kids laughed.
64,carnival_packed_away,Couples held hands.
65,carnival_packed_away,Someone won a giant stuffed bear and cheered.
66,carnival_packed_away,"Lucy stood at the edge, unseen."
67,carnival_packed_away,Unchanged on the outside.
68,carnival_packed_away,Completely changed on the inside.
69,carnival_packed_away,She closed her eyes.
70,carnival_packed_away,"For a moment she heard the fireworks again—the first ones, the bright ones, before the phone call."
71,carnival_packed_away,"She let herself feel the echo of that joy, then let it slip away."
72,carnival_packed_away,"When she opened her eyes, the carnival lights blurred in small shining streaks."
73,carnival_packed_away,She wasn’t crying because she missed the carnival.
74,carnival_packed_away,"She was crying because she finally realized that happiness, like summer, was something you couldn’t hold, no matter how tightly you tried."
