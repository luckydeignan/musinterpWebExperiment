0,starling_five,"The Starling Five launched from Orbit Station Helios just after sunrise, though sunrise was more a concept than a view at that altitude."
1,starling_five,"Still, the crew cheered as the engines burned the edge of the world into a band of shimmering gold."
2,starling_five,"Captain Mira Solène floated weightlessly in the command deck, grinning at her four teammates. “All right, team,” she said. “First deep-range survey mission."
3,starling_five,"Let’s make history.” The crew—Samir, Jin, Aleya, and Rowan—shouted back in overlapping excitement."
4,starling_five,"For them, this wasn’t just a mission; it was the realization of childhood dreams."
5,starling_five,"They’d trained together for years, bonded through simulations and sleepless nights and shared ambitions."
6,starling_five,"Their ship, The Finch, was small but engineered for elegance."
7,starling_five,"Sleek hull, experimental propulsion, advanced environmental systems."
8,starling_five,"Cutting-edge everything. “Trajectory locked,” Jin said. “Initiating jump sequence on your mark.” Mira nodded. “Mark.” The ship trembled as the jump coils activated."
9,starling_five,"Space folded, bent, shimmered— And then, with a smooth lurch, they emerged in an entirely new star system, bathed in light from a peach-colored sun."
10,starling_five,Gas giants floated like swirls of ink.
11,starling_five,A ringed planet glimmered with ice crystals.
12,starling_five,"The crew erupted into cheers. “This is insane,” Samir breathed. “We’re actually here,” Aleya whispered, eyes shining."
13,starling_five,"They spent the first two days charting magnetic fields, capturing images, collecting data."
14,starling_five,Sleep felt optional; adrenaline kept them awake.
15,starling_five,"They played music over the ship speakers, drifting through the cabin like they were dancing in a dream."
16,starling_five,"They took photos, recorded vlogs, sent messages back to Helios filled with laughter and awe."
17,starling_five,Nothing felt wrong.
18,starling_five,Until the third day.
19,starling_five,Rowan was the first to notice the slight dip in oxygen levels.
20,starling_five,Not enough to alarm anyone—ships fluctuated all the time—but enough to log it.
21,starling_five,"By day four, the dip had grown more noticeable. “Sensor malfunction?” Samir suggested. “Maybe,” Jin said."
22,starling_five,But he didn’t sound convinced.
23,starling_five,They ran diagnostics.
24,starling_five,Twice.
25,starling_five,Three times.
26,starling_five,The readings were all correct.
27,starling_five,"Something was draining oxygen from the environmental system. “Leak?” Mira asked. “No leak,” Aleya said softly. “We would have seen pressure changes.” They checked seals, conduits, tanks, vents."
28,starling_five,Everything appeared intact.
29,starling_five,"Yet the oxygen kept dropping—in tiny increments at first, then faster."
30,starling_five,"By day five, the alarms began."
31,starling_five,The crew’s excitement dissolved into focused tension.
32,starling_five,"Mira scanned every panel, every chart. “We need to isolate the cause."
33,starling_five,"We turn back now.” “Agreed,” Rowan said. “Even with conservation measures, we might not have enough to make it home.” They initiated the return jump."
34,starling_five,Nothing happened.
35,starling_five,Jin slammed the controls again. “Drive coils aren’t engaging.” “Diagnostics!” Mira ordered.
36,starling_five,"As the system analyzed itself, the crew silently gripped their seats."
37,starling_five,"The ship’s hum sounded lower now, as though it too were struggling to breathe."
38,starling_five,The results appeared on the screen: Power reroute failure.
39,starling_five,Environmental systems drawing excess energy.
40,starling_five,"Cause unknown. “What does that mean?” Samir asked, voice cracking. “It means,” Jin said, “something in our life-support system is consuming more power than it should.” “And oxygen,” Rowan added grimly."
41,starling_five,The crew worked nonstop.
42,starling_five,"Mira assigned shifts, but no one slept."
43,starling_five,"They floated through the ship like ghosts, drifting from panel to conduit to emergency manual."
44,starling_five,"On day six, the music stopped."
45,starling_five,Not by choice—the internal power-saving protocol cut non-essentials.
46,starling_five,"On day seven, sleep became unavoidable."
47,starling_five,Their words slurred.
48,starling_five,Movements slowed.
49,starling_five,"Mira caught Aleya drifting unconscious and shook her awake. “Sorry,” Aleya murmured. “Just tired.” “We all are,” Mira said softly. “But we keep going.” They found the problem on day eight."
50,starling_five,A microfracture—no larger than a fingernail—hidden in a second-layer filtration pipe.
51,starling_five,Invisible to sensors until the pressure difference grew significant.
52,starling_five,The crack allowed ambient hydrogen from their propulsion tank to seep into the oxygen filtration system.
53,starling_five,"The reaction consumed oxygen slowly at first, then exponentially as the imbalance grew."
54,starling_five,It was repairable.
55,starling_five,"In theory. “But we don’t have the materials,” Jin said quietly."
56,starling_five,Silence pressed down on them. “How long do we have?” Mira asked.
57,starling_five,Rowan checked the readings.
58,starling_five,His voice was barely audible. “Three days.” Mira steadied herself. “Then we use them.” Those final days unfolded with heartbreaking clarity.
59,starling_five,The crew stopped searching for solutions—they had tried everything.
60,starling_five,"Instead, they recorded final messages to Earth."
61,starling_five,They wrote notes to family.
62,starling_five,"They shared stories from their childhoods, laughing softly at memories that suddenly felt precious."
63,starling_five,"They floated together in the common cabin, hugging awkwardly in zero gravity."
64,starling_five,Samir cried quietly.
65,starling_five,Aleya held his hand.
66,starling_five,Jin apologized for not finding a miracle.
67,starling_five,Rowan whispered that he wasn’t ready to die in the dark.
68,starling_five,Mira told them: “We didn’t fail.
69,starling_five,We reached another star.
70,starling_five,"We did what humans always dreamed of.” But privately, she grieved harder than she’d ever imagined possible."
71,starling_five,On the last morning—if it could be called morning—the lights dimmed to emergency red.
72,starling_five,The ship’s hum grew weak.
73,starling_five,Their breaths came thin and slow.
74,starling_five,"Mira gathered the crew one final time. “Thank you,” she said. “For being my family out here.” They joined hands."
75,starling_five,"Five explorers in a dying ship, suspended in the quiet between stars."
76,starling_five,"One by one, they drifted into unconsciousness."
77,starling_five,"The Finch continued its silent path through the foreign system, her hull gleaming faintly in the peach-colored light—a tiny vessel carrying the echo of humanity’s brightest joy and its deepest sorrow."
78,starling_five,The mission log would never reach Earth.
79,starling_five,"But the ship kept going, drifting onward, as though searching for a place to lay down its final dream."
